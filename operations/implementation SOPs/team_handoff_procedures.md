# Team Handoff Procedures

### Overview
This document establishes systematic procedures for seamless knowledge transfer and responsibility handoffs between team members throughout the 48-hour implementation process. These procedures ensure continuity, prevent knowledge loss, and maintain quality standards during role transitions and shift changes.

### Handoff Framework Structure

#### **Four-Phase Handoff Model**
**Phase 1**: Pre-Implementation Team Alignment (Hours -2 to 0)
**Phase 2**: Development Phase Handoffs (Hours 1-32)
**Phase 3**: Testing and Launch Handoffs (Hours 33-48)
**Phase 4**: Post-Implementation Client Success Transition (Hours 48+)

#### **Handoff Types and Triggers**
- **Shift Change Handoffs**: 8-hour shift rotations during extended implementation
- **Role Transition Handoffs**: Specialist to specialist knowledge transfer
- **Phase Completion Handoffs**: Major milestone transitions between implementation phases
- **Emergency Handoffs**: Unplanned team member changes due to emergencies
- **Client Success Handoffs**: Final transition from implementation to ongoing support
