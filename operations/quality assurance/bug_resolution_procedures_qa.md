#### **Bug Priority Assessment Matrix**

**Priority Determination Framework:**
```markdown
Priority Assessment Criteria:
☐ Business Impact Analysis
  - Critical Business Process: High Priority
  - Secondary Process: Medium Priority
  - Nice-to-Have Feature: Low Priority
  - Enhancement Request: Lowest Priority

☐ User Impact Scope
  - All Users Affected: Critical Priority
  - Multiple Users Affected: High Priority
  - Single User Affected: Medium Priority
  - Admin/Power Users Only: Lower Priority

☐ Workaround Availability
  - No Workaround Available: Increase Priority by 1 Level
  - Difficult Workaround: Maintain Current Priority
  - Easy Workaround Available: Decrease Priority by 1 Level
  - Multiple Workarounds: Lowest Priority

☐ Client Relationship Impact
  - Executive Sponsor Visibility: Increase Priority
  - Key Stakeholder Concern: High Priority
  - General User Concern: Normal Priority
  - Internal Discovery: Standard Priority

Priority Matrix Result:
Critical + High Business Impact + No Workaround = P0 (Immediate)
High + Medium Business Impact + Difficult Workaround = P1 (Next Day)
Medium + Low Business Impact + Easy Workaround = P2 (This Week)
Low + Enhancement Request + Multiple Options = P3 (Next Release)
