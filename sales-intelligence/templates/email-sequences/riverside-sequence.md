## EMAIL 1: 3PL Industry Authority (Day 1)

**Subject:** Keith, How Elite 3PLs Are Winning More Clients

Keith,

The best 3PLs I work with share one characteristic: their clients brag about them.

"They give us better visibility than companies 10x their size."
"Their reporting is more sophisticated than Fortune 500 providers."
"They prevent problems before they happen."

What these elite 3PLs understand is that technology creates client retention. When your clients can see their inventory in real-time, get predictive analytics, and receive automated reports, they don't just stay – they refer others.

Riverside Logistics has the operational excellence. The question is: do you have the technology platform that lets your clients experience it?

Worth exploring?

## EMAIL 3: Client Retention (Day 7)

**Subject:** The #1 Reason 3PL Clients Switch Providers (It's Not Price)

Keith,

"Lack of visibility and communication."

That's the top reason companies leave their 3PL provider, according to a recent logistics survey. Price comes in 4th.

Your clients want to know:
• Where is my inventory right now?
• When will my shipment arrive?  
• Are there any potential issues?
• How is my supply chain performing?

The 3PLs that answer these questions automatically (not when asked) are the ones that keep clients for decades.

Riverside Logistics has 25+ years of operational expertise. Imagine if your clients could experience that expertise through real-time dashboards, predictive alerts, and automated insights.

That's the difference between a service provider and a strategic partner.

Ready to see what this looks like?

## EMAIL 4: Social Proof (Day 11)

**Subject:** How This 3PL Increased Client Retention to 98%

Keith,

"Our clients used to call us constantly for updates. Now they have better visibility into their operations than they do with their own internal systems."

That's from a 3PL president who implemented our client portal system six months ago. His results:
• 98% client retention rate (up from 87%)
• 34% increase in revenue per client
• 60% reduction in customer service calls
• Two major clients increased their volume by 40%

The key insight: when clients can see real-time data and predictive analytics, they view you as an extension of their team rather than just a vendor.

"We've gone from competing on price to being irreplaceable," he told me last week.

Would a conversation with him be valuable?

## EMAIL 5: Competitive Pressure (Day 15)

**Subject:** Your Biggest 3PL Competitors Are Already Doing This

Keith,

While you've been focused on operational excellence, here's what's happening in the 3PL market:

• Large providers are investing millions in client-facing technology
• New startups are launching with automation-first approaches  
• Mid-size 3PLs like Riverside are caught in the middle

The companies that bridge the gap first will dominate the next decade.

Riverside has the advantage:
• Better service than the large providers
• More resources than the startups
• 25+ years of operational expertise
• Strong client relationships to build on

The missing piece is the technology platform that showcases your capabilities.

Ready to leapfrog both the big guys and the startups?

## EMAIL 6: Value Reframe (Day 20)

**Subject:** $7.5K Investment for $1.3M+ Annual Benefit?

Keith,

Let me put this in 3PL perspective:

**Your current situation:**
• Manual client reporting taking 20+ hours/week
• Clients asking for updates you can't easily provide
• Competing primarily on service and price
• Limited differentiation from other mid-size 3PLs

**With automation:**
• Clients get real-time visibility and predictive insights
• You become their strategic technology partner
• Premium pricing for superior service
• $1.3M+ in annual benefits vs. $7.5K investment

The question isn't whether you can afford this – it's whether you can afford to let competitors implement this first.

What's your biggest concern about moving forward?
