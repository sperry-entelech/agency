## OBJECTION RESPONSE - PRICE

**Subject:** Re: Investment Concerns for [Company] Automation

[Name],

I completely understand your concern about the investment level. Let me provide some additional context:

**Return on Investment:**
• Your annual revenue: $[X]M
• This investment: $[Y]K (represents [%] of revenue)
• Annual savings we generate: $[Z]K
• Payback period: [X] days

**Risk Mitigation:**
• 30-day money-back guarantee
• You own all infrastructure (no vendor lock-in)
• 20% upfront, 80% only after successful implementation

**Financing Options:**
• Extended payment terms available
• Phased implementation approach
• Performance-based payment structure

The real question isn't the cost – it's the cost of not capturing $[savings] in annual improvements while competitors gain automation advantages.

Happy to discuss alternative approaches that work within your budget.

Best,
Ethan

## OBJECTION RESPONSE - TIMING

**Subject:** Re: Timing Concerns for [Company] Automation

[Name],

I understand that timing is crucial for any major operational change.

**Cost of Waiting:**
• Every month delayed = $[monthly savings] in lost efficiency
• Competitors implementing automation gain 2-3 year advantages
• Manual processes become harder to change as they become more entrenched

**Implementation Flexibility:**
• 48-hour deployment can work around your schedule
• Phased rollout to minimize disruption
• Training during slow operational periods
• Parallel operation during transition

**Future Timeline Challenges:**
• Our implementation capacity is limited (15 clients/month)
• Technology costs likely to increase
• Labor shortages making automation more urgent

What would need to change for automation to become a priority? Market conditions, growth stage, competitive pressure?

Happy to discuss a timeline that works for [Company].

Best,
Ethan
