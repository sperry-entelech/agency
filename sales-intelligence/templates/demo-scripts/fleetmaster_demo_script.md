# Fleetmaster Express Demo Script

## PRE-DEMO SETUP (5 minutes)

**OPENING:**
"Carl, I'm going to show you exactly how this looks for a multi-terminal operation like Fleetmaster. Everything you'll see can be deployed to your 8 terminals within 48 hours."

**CONTEXT SETTING:**
"Let me start with a scenario that probably happens daily: It's 7 AM, you have 300+ trucks across 8 terminals, and you need to optimize routes, coordinate dispatches, and keep customers updated. Here's how that looks with automation..."

## DEMO SEQUENCE 1: Multi-Terminal Dashboard (10 minutes)

**SCREEN:** Multi-terminal command center dashboard

**NARRATION:**
"This is your executive dashboard. Right now, you can see all 8 terminals in real-time:

• Roanoke: 47 trucks active, 12 loading, 3 maintenance alerts
• North Carolina: 38 trucks active, optimal routing efficiency at 94%
• Ohio: 29 trucks active, 2 weather delays automatically rerouted
• Texas: 52 trucks active, fuel optimization saving $1,247 today
• Georgia: 41 trucks active, 6 temperature alerts on produce loads

**INTERACTION POINT:**
"Carl, what's the biggest challenge you have coordinating between terminals right now?"

[Listen to response, then demonstrate specific solution]

**KEY FEATURES TO HIGHLIGHT:**
• Real-time visibility across all terminals
• Automated alert system for exceptions
• Performance metrics by terminal
• One-click drill-down to specific issues

## DEMO SEQUENCE 2: Predictive Maintenance (8 minutes)

**SCREEN:** Fleet maintenance dashboard

**NARRATION:**

[Show truck #247 - Kenworth T680]
• Current mileage: 487,245
• Next scheduled maintenance: 2,847 miles
• AI prediction: Recommend early service in 1,200 miles
• Reason: Brake sensor data showing early wear patterns
• Cost impact: $340 repair vs $2,800 roadside breakdown

[Show fleet overview]
• 23 trucks flagged for early maintenance this week
• Projected savings: $47,000 in avoided breakdowns
• Optimal scheduling across 8 terminals to minimize downtime

**INTERACTION POINT:**
"How much does an unexpected breakdown cost you in lost revenue and customer impact?"

**VALUE STATEMENT:**
"This system pays for itself with just 5 prevented breakdowns."

## DEMO SEQUENCE 3: Customer Portal (7 minutes)

**SCREEN:** Branded customer portal for grocery chain

**NARRATION:**
"Your grocery chain clients see this white-labeled portal with Fleetmaster branding:

[Show shipment tracking]
• Load #FL-4429: Produce from Roanoke to Atlanta
• Real-time GPS tracking with temperature monitoring
• Estimated arrival: 2:47 PM (updated every 5 minutes)
• Temperature log: Constant 34°F, no deviations
• Automatic alerts if any temperature variance occurs

[Show analytics dashboard for client]
• On-time performance: 98.7% (industry average: 85%)
• Average transit time: 12% faster than contracted
• Cost savings through optimization: $23,400 this quarter

**INTERACTION POINT:**
"How often do your grocery clients call asking for shipment updates?"

**VALUE STATEMENT:**
"This eliminates 90% of customer service calls and positions you as the premium provider."

## DISCOVERY QUESTIONS DURING DEMO

**PAIN POINT DISCOVERY:**
• "What's your biggest operational headache right now?"
• "How much time does your team spend on terminal coordination?"
• "What would automated dispatch coordination mean for your business?"
• "How do you currently handle maintenance scheduling across 8 locations?"

**VALUE VALIDATION:**
• "Does this solve the coordination problem you described?"
• "What would $400K in annual fuel savings mean for Fleetmaster?"
• "How would your customers react to this level of visibility?"
• "What questions do you have about implementing this across 8 terminals?"

## OBJECTION HANDLING DURING DEMO

**"TOO COMPLEX":**
Response: "I understand it looks sophisticated, but remember - this deploys in 48 hours. Your team doesn't build it, maintain it, or troubleshoot it. You just use it."

**"TOO EXPENSIVE":**
Response: "Let me show you the ROI calculator again. At your scale, this pays for itself in 2.1 days. After that, it's $2.5M in annual profit improvement."

**"WE HAVE EXISTING SYSTEMS":**
Response: "Perfect. Look at this integration dashboard - we connect with your current TMS and enhance it rather than replace it."

## DEMO CLOSING

**SUMMARY CLOSE:**
"So we've shown you how this solves terminal coordination, prevents costly breakdowns, and positions you as the premium carrier your grocery clients prefer. What questions do you have about implementing this across Fleetmaster's operation?"

**NEXT STEPS:**
"When we implement this for Fleetmaster, should we start with your largest terminals or would you prefer to deploy everything simultaneously across all 8 locations?"
