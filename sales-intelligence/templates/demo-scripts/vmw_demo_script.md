## EXPRESS DELIVERY OBJECTION HANDLING

**"WE ALREADY HAVE GOOD ON-TIME PERFORMANCE":**
Response: "That's excellent - good performance is the foundation of express delivery. This system takes you from good to exceptional. The difference between 95% and 99.5% on-time performance is what separates premium providers from everyone else."

**"CUSTOMERS EXPECT DELAYS SOMETIMES":**
Response: "That used to be true, but customer expectations have changed. Amazon has trained everyone to expect real-time tracking and proactive communication. Your premium pricing depends on exceeding those expectations."

**"TOO MUCH TECHNOLOGY FOR OUR DRIVERS":**
Response: "I understand that concern. Your drivers see a simple mobile app that's easier to use than their personal GPS. All the complexity happens behind the scenes - they just follow optimized routes and get automatic updates."
