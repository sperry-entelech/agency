# ROI Calculation Frameworks

## Master ROI Calculation Formula

### Comprehensive ROI Analysis Framework

```
Total Annual Benefit = Time Savings Value + Revenue Impact + Cost Reduction + Risk Mitigation
Total Investment = Implementation Cost + Ongoing Costs + Internal Time Investment
ROI = (Total Annual Benefit - Total Investment) / Total Investment × 100%
Payback Period = Total Investment / (Total Annual Benefit / 12)
```

### Core ROI Components

#### 1. Time Savings Value
**Formula:** `Weekly Hours Saved × Hourly Rate × 52 Weeks = Annual Time Savings Value`

**Time Savings Categories:**
- **Administrative Tasks:** Manual data entry, status updates, reporting
- **Communication Overhead:** Phone calls, emails, coordination meetings
- **Process Coordination:** Manual handoffs, status tracking, follow-ups
- **Documentation:** Manual record keeping, compliance reporting

**Hourly Rate Calculation:**
- **Owner/Executive Time:** $75-$150/hour (based on revenue per employee)
- **Manager Time:** $50-$75/hour
- **Administrative Time:** $25-$40/hour
- **Technician Time:** $35-$60/hour

#### 2. Revenue Impact
**Formula:** `Additional Capacity × Average Project Value × Conversion Rate = Revenue Increase`

**Revenue Enhancement Sources:**
- **Increased Capacity:** Time freed enables additional projects/clients
- **Faster Response Times:** Quicker quotes/responses increase win rates
- **Improved Service Quality:** Higher retention and premium pricing
- **Reduced Cycle Times:** Faster project completion enables more volume

#### 3. Cost Reduction
**Formula:** `Eliminated Expenses + Efficiency Gains + Error Reduction = Annual Cost Savings`

**Cost Reduction Categories:**
- **Labor Cost Elimination:** Reduced manual processing requirements
- **Error Cost Reduction:** Fewer mistakes requiring rework/refunds
- **Operational Efficiency:** Reduced fuel, overtime, emergency costs
- **Technology Consolidation:** Eliminating redundant software/tools

#### 4. Risk Mitigation Value
**Formula:** `Risk Probability × Financial Impact × Risk Reduction % = Risk Mitigation Value`

**Risk Categories:**
- **Compliance Violations:** DOT fines, safety violations, audit failures
- **Customer Churn:** Lost clients due to service quality issues
- **Data Loss:** Manual process failures and human error
- **Competitive Disadvantage:** Market share loss to automated competitors

### Transportation & Logistics ROI Framework

#### Primary Value Drivers
**Communication Automation:**
- Current State: 127 status calls daily × 3 minutes = 6.35 hours
- Automated State: 12 status calls daily × 3 minutes = 0.6 hours  
- Time Savings: 5.75 hours daily × $25/hour × 260 days = $37,375 annually

**Route Optimization:**
- Current State: 15% fuel waste × $80,000 annual fuel = $12,000 waste
- Automated State: 3% fuel waste × $80,000 annual fuel = $2,400 waste
- Cost Savings: $9,600 annually

**Documentation Efficiency:**
- Current State: 15 hours weekly × $35/hour × 52 weeks = $27,300
- Automated State: 3 hours weekly × $35/hour × 52 weeks = $5,460
- Time Savings: $21,840 annually

#### Transportation ROI Calculator Template
```
INPUTS:
- Fleet Size: _____ vehicles
- Annual Fuel Costs: $______
- Dispatcher Hours on Communication: _____ hours/week
- Administrative Hours Weekly: _____ hours
- Average Driver Hourly Rate: $______
- Current First-Time Fix Rate: _____%

CALCULATIONS:
Communication Savings = (Current Communication Hours - Automated Hours) × Dispatcher Rate × 52
Route Optimization = Current Fuel Costs × 12% efficiency gain
Documentation Savings = (Current Admin Hours - Automated Hours) × Admin Rate × 52
Customer Satisfaction = Improved retention × Average Customer Value

TOTAL ANNUAL BENEFIT = Communication + Route + Documentation + Retention
INVESTMENT = $12,500 implementation + $2,400 annual platform
ROI = (Total Annual Benefit - Total Investment) / Total Investment × 100%
```

### Professional Services ROI Framework

Capacity Increase = Additional billable hours × Rate × 52

TOTAL ANNUAL BENEFIT = Time + Efficiency + Retention + Capacity
INVESTMENT = $15,000 implementation + $3,600 annual platform
ROI = (Total Annual Benefit - Total Investment) / Total Investment × 100%
```

### Field Service ROI Framework

#### Primary Value Drivers
**Schedule Optimization:**
- Current State: 35% travel time × 8 hours × $45/hour × 5 techs = $630 daily
- Automated State: 20% travel time × 8 hours × $45/hour × 5 techs = $360 daily
- Travel Efficiency: $270 daily × 260 days = $70,200 annually

**First-Time Fix Improvement:**
- Current State: 65% first-time fix × 100 jobs monthly × $150 average
- Automated State: 85% first-time fix × 100 jobs monthly × $150 average
- Additional Revenue: 20 jobs × $150 × 12 months = $36,000 annually

**Parts Management:**
- Current State: 25% overstock + 15% emergency orders = 40% waste
- Automated State: 10% overstock + 3% emergency orders = 13% waste
