### Objection Prevention Strategies

#### Common Objections and Pre-Frames
**"We're too busy to implement new systems"**

**"We've tried automation before and it didn't work"**
Pre-frame: "What specifically didn't work about your previous experience? Most automation failures happen because of lengthy implementations that lose momentum. Our rapid deployment prevents those issues."

**"We need to get organized first"**
Pre-frame: "Actually, automation helps you get organized. Waiting for perfect processes means waiting forever. We automate your current workflows and then optimize from there."

**"We're not sure about the ROI"**
Pre-frame: "ROI uncertainty is completely understandable. That's why we guarantee measurable results within 90 days. If you don't see the promised ROI, we'll keep optimizing until you do."
