```
[ON SCREEN: Dashboard login and main view]

NARRATOR:
"When you first log in, you'll see three main sections designed specifically for your business.

At the top, your Performance Overview gives you instant insight into how your automations are working. The green indicators show everything is running smoothly - this is what you'll see most of the time.

In the middle, your Active Automations section shows each process we've automated for you. You can see when they last ran, when they'll run next, and their current status.

At the bottom, your Reporting Center gives you access to all the data and insights about your time savings, cost reductions, and ROI."

```

**[SCENE 3: Navigation and Key Features - 60 seconds]**
```
[ON SCREEN: Detailed walkthrough of dashboard features]

NARRATOR:
"Let's look at the most important features you'll use daily.

This System Status indicator is your health check. Green means perfect, yellow means worth watching, and red means contact support immediately.

Your time savings tracker shows exactly how much time automation has saved you this week. This number updates in real-time as your processes run.

The activity feed shows you what's happening with your automations. You can see completed processes, upcoming schedules, and any items that need your attention.

And this alerts panel - if you ever see anything here, it's usually just informational, but red alerts need immediate attention."

[VISUAL: Click through each feature, showing real data]
```

**[SCENE 4: Quick Actions and Wrap-up - 45 seconds]**
```
[ON SCREEN: Quick action buttons and menu options]

NARRATOR:
"For quick actions, these buttons let you manually trigger processes if needed, though most of the time everything runs automatically.

The reports menu gives you detailed insights you can share with stakeholders, and the support button connects you directly to our team.

Remember, bookmark this page for daily access, and don't hesitate to explore. Everything is designed to be intuitive, and you can't break anything by clicking around.

Your Client Success Manager will review all of this with you in more detail during your Week 1 call. Welcome to your automation journey!"

## VIDEO 2: DAILY WORKFLOW INTEGRATION (5 minutes)

### Pre-Production Notes
- **Target Audience:** Daily users, operations team
- **Objective:** Show how automation fits into existing workflows
- **Tone:** Practical, reassuring, empowering
- **Screen Recording:** Required for process demonstrations

### Script

**[SCENE 1: Introduction - 30 seconds]**
```
[ON SCREEN: Office setting, then screen capture of workflow]

NARRATOR:
"Now that you've seen your dashboard, let's talk about how automation integrates with your daily work. The good news? For most processes, you'll barely notice the automation is running - it just makes everything faster and more reliable.

In this video, we'll walk through a typical day and show you exactly when to interact with your automations and when to simply let them work their magic."

```

**[SCENE 2: Morning Routine - 90 seconds]**
```
[ON SCREEN: Dashboard morning check, email notifications]

NARRATOR:
"Start each day with a quick dashboard check - just like checking your email. This takes about 30 seconds.

Look for any red alerts first, though these are rare. Yellow indicators might show minor issues worth noting, but usually don't require immediate action.

Check your overnight activity. For example, if you process invoices, you'll see how many were handled automatically while you slept. If you manage leads, you'll see new entries that were captured and routed to your CRM.

The beautiful thing is, all this work happened without you. Your job is simply to verify everything looks normal and then focus on higher-value activities."

[VISUAL: Real dashboard showing overnight activity logs]
```

**[SCENE 3: When to Intervene vs. Let It Run - 120 seconds]**
```
[ON SCREEN: Split screen showing automated vs. manual scenarios]

NARRATOR:
"Here's the key question: when should you intervene, and when should you let automation handle things?

Let automation run when:
- Status indicators are green
- Processes are completing on schedule
- Data looks accurate and complete
- Everything matches your expectations

Intervene when:
- You see red status indicators
- Data seems incomplete or inaccurate
- A process hasn't run when expected
- You receive an alert notification

For example, if your lead processing automation encounters a lead with incomplete information, it might flag this for manual review rather than making assumptions. This is the system being smart, not broken.

Most interventions are simple - like adding missing information or confirming an unusual data point. The automation does the heavy lifting; you just provide the human judgment when needed."

[VISUAL: Examples of both scenarios with clear visual indicators]
```

**[SCENE 4: Integration with Team Workflows - 90 seconds]**
```
[ON SCREEN: Team collaboration scenarios]

NARRATOR:
"If you have team members using the system, here's how workflows typically flow:

Team members can access the same dashboard with appropriate permissions. They'll see the same status indicators and can perform the same basic monitoring tasks.

For shared processes, like customer onboarding, everyone can see progress and status, but you can designate who handles exceptions or manual reviews.

The key is communication. Use your regular team meetings to review automation performance, discuss any patterns you're seeing, and identify opportunities for optimization.

Remember, automation doesn't replace your team's expertise - it amplifies it by handling routine tasks so your team can focus on strategy, relationships, and growth."

[VISUAL: Multiple user perspectives, team meeting scenario]
```

**[SCENE 5: Common Scenarios and Best Practices - 90 seconds]**
```
[ON SCREEN: Real-world examples and tips]

NARRATOR:
"Let's cover some common scenarios and best practices:

Scenario 1: Busy periods. During high-volume times, automation becomes even more valuable. Monitor your capacity indicators and contact your CSM if you're approaching system limits.

Scenario 2: Data discrepancies. If automated data doesn't match your expectations, don't assume the automation is wrong. Often, it's revealing inconsistencies in your source data that need attention.

Scenario 3: Process changes. When your business processes evolve, let your CSM know. We can adjust automations to match your new workflows.

Best practices: Check your dashboard daily, but don't overthink it. Trust the automation to work, but stay engaged enough to spot optimization opportunities. And always remember - you have 24/7 support if anything seems off."

[VISUAL: Examples of each scenario with resolution steps]
```

**[SCENE 6: Wrap-up and Next Steps - 30 seconds]**
```
[ON SCREEN: Summary points and contact information]

NARRATOR:
"The bottom line: automation should make your work life easier, not more complicated. Start with these simple daily habits, trust the system to do its job, and don't hesitate to reach out with questions.

Your Week 1 optimization call will dive deeper into your specific workflows. Until then, explore, experiment, and enjoy getting time back in your day!"

## VIDEO 3: TROUBLESHOOTING & SUPPORT (4 minutes)

### Pre-Production Notes
- **Target Audience:** All users, focus on problem resolution
- **Objective:** Empower users to handle common issues and know when to seek help
- **Tone:** Calm, confident, solution-focused
- **Screen Recording:** Required for troubleshooting demonstrations

### Script

**[SCENE 1: Introduction - 30 seconds]**
```
[ON SCREEN: Split screen showing problem and solution]

NARRATOR:
"Even the best automation systems occasionally need attention, and that's completely normal. In this video, you'll learn how to identify issues, handle common problems yourself, and know exactly when and how to get help from our support team.

Most importantly, you'll discover that most 'problems' are actually just the system being extra careful with your data."

[VISUAL: Dashboard showing various status indicators]
```

**[SCENE 2: Understanding Status Indicators - 60 seconds]**
```
[ON SCREEN: Dashboard with different status scenarios]

NARRATOR:
"Let's start with status indicators - your early warning system.

Green means perfect operation. No action needed from you.

Yellow typically means the automation completed successfully but flagged something for your attention. For example, it might have processed 99 invoices automatically but flagged 1 that had unusual formatting for manual review. This isn't a failure - it's the system being intelligently cautious.

Red means something prevented the automation from completing. This could be a connectivity issue, missing data, or an unexpected error. Red status always requires action, either from you or our support team.

The key insight: yellow and red indicators don't mean the system is broken. They mean it's working exactly as designed - being careful with your business data."

[VISUAL: Real examples of each status type with explanations]
```

**[SCENE 3: Common Issues and Self-Service Solutions - 90 seconds]**
```
[ON SCREEN: Step-by-step troubleshooting demonstrations]

NARRATOR:
"Here are the most common issues and how to handle them:

Issue 1: Can't access dashboard. First, check your internet connection, then try clearing your browser cache or using an incognito window. If that doesn't work, contact support.

Issue 2: Automation shows yellow status. Click on the status indicator to see details. Usually, it's asking you to review flagged items. Handle the review, then the status will return to green.

Issue 3: Process didn't run when expected. Check if there were any system maintenance notifications, verify source data was available, and look for any error messages. If nothing obvious, contact support.

Issue 4: Data doesn't look right. Compare with your source system, check if any manual changes were made, and verify the time period you're viewing. If discrepancies remain, contact support immediately.

Remember: when in doubt, it's always better to ask than to guess."

[VISUAL: Screen recordings of each troubleshooting scenario]
```

**[SCENE 4: When and How to Contact Support - 90 seconds]**
```
[ON SCREEN: Support contact methods and escalation process]

NARRATOR:
"Here's exactly when to contact support and how to do it effectively:

Contact support immediately for:
- Any red status indicators
- Data accuracy concerns
- Login or access problems that basic troubleshooting doesn't solve
- Questions about whether something is working correctly

For general questions or training needs, email support@entelech.net. Include your client name, a clear description of the issue, and screenshots if helpful.

For urgent issues affecting your business operations, call our emergency support line. 'Urgent' means your business processes are stopped or significantly impacted.

When contacting support, provide:
- Your name and company
- What you were trying to do
- What happened instead
- Any error messages you saw
- Screenshots of the issue

This helps us resolve issues faster and more accurately."

```

**[SCENE 5: Preventive Measures and Best Practices - 60 seconds]**
```
[ON SCREEN: Dashboard maintenance and monitoring tips]

NARRATOR:
"Prevention is always better than troubleshooting. Here are best practices to keep your automation running smoothly:

Daily: Quick dashboard check for status indicators and alerts.

Weekly: Review performance reports for any declining trends.

Monthly: Discuss patterns and optimization opportunities with your CSM.

Keep your source systems maintained - many automation issues actually stem from problems in connected systems, not the automation itself.

Don't ignore yellow status indicators. While not urgent, addressing flagged items promptly prevents them from becoming larger issues.

Stay informed about scheduled maintenance through our notifications, and plan accordingly."

```

**[SCENE 6: Advanced Support and Escalation - 30 seconds]**
```
[ON SCREEN: Support team structure and escalation path]

NARRATOR:
"Remember, you have multiple levels of support:

Your Client Success Manager for strategic questions and optimization opportunities.

Technical support for immediate issue resolution.

Senior technical specialists for complex problems.

Executive escalation for critical business issues.

We're committed to your success, and no question is too small. Our goal is to keep your automation running perfectly so you can focus on growing your business."

**[SCENE 7: Wrap-up and Confidence Building - 30 seconds]**
```
[ON SCREEN: Summary and encouragement]

NARRATOR:
"Most clients find that after the first month, they rarely need to troubleshoot anything. The system becomes second nature, and issues become increasingly rare as everything stabilizes.

Trust the automation, monitor intelligently, and don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to ensure your success every step of the way."
